# To Do


- [ ] Make a CSG to voxel space converter, where the CSG object can be angled over the X/Y-axis (called A and B)
- [ ] Make a CSG to height-field converter
- [ ] Make a height-field to CSG tool-volume (which can be used in the next step)
- [ ] Make a CSG-tool-volume to G-code converter

- [ ] Make a 6-axis finishing pass by visiting each surface voxel with the tool close to normal.
